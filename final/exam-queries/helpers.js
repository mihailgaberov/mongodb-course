        * LAB #1A: Implement the getCategories() method.
        *
        * Write an aggregation query on the "item" collection to return the
        * total number of items in each category. The documents in the array
        * output by your aggregation should contain fields for "_id" and "num".
        *
        * HINT: Test your mongodb query in the shell first before implementing
        * it in JavaScript.
        *
        * In addition to the categories created by your aggregation query,
        * include a document for category "All" in the array of categories
        * passed to the callback. The "All" category should contain the total
        * number of items across all categories as its value for "num". The
        * most efficient way to calculate this value is to iterate through
        * the array of categories produced by your aggregation query, summing
        * counts of items in each category.
        *
        * Ensure categories are organized in alphabetical order before passing
        * to the callback.
